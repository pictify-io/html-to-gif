# AWS t3.medium Configuration Guide

## Instance Specifications

```yaml
Instance Type: t3.medium
vCPUs: 2
RAM: 4 GB
Architecture: x86_64
CPU: Burstable (with CPU Credits)
Network: Up to 5 Gigabit
Storage: EBS-optimized
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: t3.medium Considerations

### CPU Credits (Burstable Performance)
- **Baseline**: 20% CPU utilization per vCPU
- **CPU Credits**: Accumulate when below baseline, consume when above
- **Burst**: Can burst to 100% when credits available
- **Monitoring**: Watch CloudWatch for CPU credit balance

### Memory Constraints
- **Total**: 4GB RAM
- **OS Overhead**: ~500-800MB
- **Available for App**: ~3.2GB
- **Per Browser**: ~500MB-1GB
- **Safe Concurrent**: 3 browsers √ó 8 pages = 24 concurrent GIFs

---

## Browser Pool Configuration

### Current Settings (Optimized for t3.medium)

```javascript
MAX_BROWSERS = 3              // Tuned for 4GB RAM
MIN_BROWSERS = 1              // Conservative baseline
MAX_PAGES_PER_BROWSER = 8     // Reduced for memory
MAX_CONCURRENT = 24           // Total capacity
```

### Memory Usage Breakdown

| Component | Memory per Unit | Count | Total |
|-----------|----------------|-------|-------|
| Chromium Browser | 150-300 MB | 3 | 900 MB |
| Page Context | 50-100 MB | 24 | 2,400 MB |
| Node.js Process | 200-300 MB | 1 | 300 MB |
| FFmpeg (per GIF) | 50-100 MB | ~3 avg | 225 MB |
| **Total Active** | | | **~3,825 MB** |
| **OS + Buffer** | | | **~500 MB** |
| **Peak Usage** | | | **~4,300 MB** |

‚ö†Ô∏è **At peak load, expect to use ~95% of RAM** - this is normal!

## Capacity Analysis for 40k GIFs/month

### Target Load
```
40,000 GIFs/month
= 1,333 GIFs/day
= 55.5 GIFs/hour
= 0.93 GIFs/minute
= 0.0155 GIFs/second
```

### t3.medium Capacity

**With 24 concurrent pages:**
```
Average GIF time: 20 seconds (conservative for 2 vCPU)
Throughput: 24/20 = 1.2 GIFs/second
= 72 GIFs/minute
= 4,320 GIFs/hour
= 103,680 GIFs/day
= 3,110,400 GIFs/month
```

**Result: 77.8x your target capacity** ‚úÖ

**At 10x peak load:**
```
Required: 0.155 GIFs/second (10x average)
Capacity: 1.2 GIFs/second
Headroom: 7.7x even at 10x peak
```

---

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. **Browser Pool** ‚úÖ
- Reduced from 5 to 3 browsers (memory-aware)
- Reduced pages per browser from 10 to 8
- Total capacity: 24 concurrent (sufficient for 40k/month)

### 2. **Memory Management** ‚úÖ
- Page recycling after 50 uses
- Health checks every 30s
- Idle browser cleanup after 5 minutes
- Aggressive garbage collection

### 3. **Processing** ‚úÖ
- WebP screenshots (faster than PNG)
- Parallel frame processing
- Optimized Sharp settings
- FFmpeg palette optimization

### 4. **S3 Upload** ‚úÖ
- 10MB multipart chunks
- 4 concurrent parts
- Connection pooling
- 2MB stream buffers

---

## Performance Expectations

### Average Load (Light)
```
Concurrent: 2 GIFs
CPU: 30-50%
Memory: 1.5-2.5 GB
Response Time: 15-20s
Success Rate: 99%+
```

### Peak Load (10x Average)
```
Concurrent: 8 GIFs
CPU: 70-85%
Memory: 3.0-3.5 GB
Response Time: 20-30s
Success Rate: 95%+
```

### Maximum Burst
```
Concurrent: 24 GIFs
CPU: 90-100% (using credits)
Memory: 3.5-4.0 GB
Response Time: 25-35s
Success Rate: 90%+
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Sustained max burst will deplete CPU credits**

---

## Monitoring Thresholds

### ‚úÖ Healthy
```
Memory: < 3.2 GB (80%)
CPU: < 70% (preserving credits)
Response Time P95: < 25s
Success Rate: > 98%
CPU Credits: > 50
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
```
Memory: 3.2-3.6 GB (80-90%)
CPU: 70-85% (consuming credits)
Response Time P95: 25-35s
Success Rate: 95-98%
CPU Credits: 20-50
```

### üö® Critical
```
Memory: > 3.6 GB (90%+)
CPU: > 85% (rapid credit depletion)
Response Time P95: > 35s
Success Rate: < 95%
CPU Credits: < 20
```

---

## CloudWatch Metrics to Monitor

### Essential Metrics
```bash
# CPU Utilization
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-xxxxx

# CPU Credit Balance
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --metric-name CPUCreditBalance \
  --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-xxxxx

# Memory (requires CloudWatch agent)
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace CWAgent \
  --metric-name mem_used_percent \
  --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-xxxxx
```

### Recommended Alarms
```yaml
CPU Utilization > 85%: Warning (check credits)
CPU Credits < 50: Warning (may throttle)
CPU Credits < 20: Critical (upgrade needed)
Memory > 3.2GB: Warning
Memory > 3.6GB: Critical
```

## Stress Test Configuration

### Adjusted Scenarios for t3.medium

```javascript
// Scenario 0: Light Load
concurrent: 2
totalRequests: 20
// Should: Pass easily, <50% CPU, <2.5GB RAM

// Scenario 1: Medium Load
concurrent: 3
totalRequests: 30
// Should: Pass comfortably, ~60% CPU, ~2.8GB RAM

// Scenario 2: Heavy Load
concurrent: 5
totalRequests: 50
// Should: Pass, ~75% CPU, ~3.2GB RAM

// Scenario 3: Peak Load
concurrent: 8
totalRequests: 80
// Should: Pass but use CPU credits, ~85% CPU, ~3.5GB RAM

// Scenario 4: Sustained Load
concurrent: 3
totalRequests: 180 (over 1 hour)
// Should: Pass, stable ~60% CPU, ~2.8GB RAM
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Start with light load
node test/stress-test-gif.js

# Check CPU credits after each test
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --metric-name CPUCreditBalance \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --start-time 2025-01-06T00:00:00Z \
  --end-time 2025-01-06T23:59:59Z \
  --period 3600 \
  --statistics Average \
  --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=YOUR_INSTANCE_ID
```

## Scaling Recommendations

### When to Upgrade from t3.medium

Upgrade if you experience:

1. **Consistent CPU > 80%** for extended periods
2. **CPU Credits depleted** regularly
3. **Memory > 90%** frequently
4. **Response times > 30s** consistently
5. **Success rate < 95%** regularly
6. **Growth beyond 80k GIFs/month**

### Recommended Upgrade Paths

#### Option 1: t3.large (Staying in t3 family)
```yaml
vCPUs: 2
RAM: 8 GB
Cost: ~$60/month (vs $30 for t3.medium)
Capacity: 2x t3.medium
Benefits: More memory, same CPU credits
```

#### Option 2: c6i.large (Compute-optimized)
```yaml
vCPUs: 2
RAM: 4 GB
Cost: ~$62/month
Capacity: 1.5x t3.medium (sustained)
Benefits: No CPU credits, consistent performance
```

#### Option 3: t3.xlarge (Big jump)
```yaml
vCPUs: 4
RAM: 16 GB
Cost: ~$120/month
Capacity: 4x t3.medium
Benefits: Handles 160k+ GIFs/month easily
```

## Cost Optimization Tips

### 1. Use Reserved Instances
```
1-year reserved: 40% savings
3-year reserved: 60% savings
For stable workload: ~$18-22/month
```

### 2. Monitor CPU Credits
```bash
# If credits stay high, consider t3.small (save $15/month)
# If credits deplete, must upgrade to t3.large or c-series
```

### 3. Auto-scaling (for future)
```yaml
# When traffic grows
Min: 1 √ó t3.medium
Max: 3 √ó t3.medium
Load balancer: Application Load Balancer
Scaling trigger: CPU > 70% or Memory > 80%
```

  "browserPool": {...},
  "pagePool": {...},
  "memory": {...}
}
```

### System Monitoring Script
```bash
# Save as monitor.sh
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  echo "=== $(date) ==="
  
  # Memory
  free -h | grep Mem
  
  # CPU
  top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)"
  
  # Node process
  ps aux | grep node | grep -v grep
  
  # Health endpoint
  curl -s http://localhost:3000/gif/health | jq .memory
  
  echo ""
  sleep 60
done
```

## Troubleshooting t3.medium

### Issue: High Memory Usage (>90%)

**Symptoms:**
- OOM errors
- Browser crashes
- Slow performance

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce MAX_BROWSERS from 3 to 2
2. Reduce MAX_PAGES_PER_BROWSER from 8 to 6
3. Lower MAX_PAGE_REUSE from 50 to 30
4. Enable swap (temporary):
   ```bash
   sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
   sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
   sudo mkswap /swapfile
   sudo swapon /swapfile
   ```
5. **Best solution:** Upgrade to t3.large

### Issue: CPU Credits Depleting

**Symptoms:**
- CPU throttled to 20% per vCPU
- Slow response times
- Timeouts

**Solutions:**
1. Monitor credit balance:
   ```bash
   aws cloudwatch get-metric-data --metric-data-queries ...
   ```
2. Reduce concurrent load during credit depletion
3. Consider t3.unlimited mode (extra charges)
4. **Best solution:** Upgrade to c6i.large (no credits)

### Issue: Slow Response Times

**Check:**
1. CPU credits available?
2. Memory pressure?
3. S3 upload speed?
4. Network latency?

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check CPU credits
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep MHz

# Check memory
free -h

# Check network
curl -o /dev/null -s -w '%{time_total}\n' https://s3.amazonaws.com
```
